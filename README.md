5. Random number generator 

    Objectives - Generate two lists (sets) of random numbers and then sort in ascending order the intersection and union of the two sets. Then print off the union of the two sets follled by a and b sorted into ascending order. Given that the universal set is the whole numbers between 0 and 200 inclusive form and print ~A in ascending order. Form and print A-B in ascending order.
